Designing a robust and efficient mesh network for real-time environmental monitoring using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) faces challenges due to resource constraints. RPL emerges as a promising solution \cite{rechache_study_2021, alexander_rpl_2012, Kharrufa2019RPL-Based}, offering dynamic routing, energy efficiency \cite{info8040124}, and scalability. D-RPL enhances multihop routing \cite{kharrufa_dynamic_2017}. Security concerns \cite{arena_evaluating_2020, mayzaud_distributed_2017, 8998289} and protocol complexity \cite{kharrufa_dynamic_2017} require attention. Optimizing RPL's features can facilitate timely data collection in dynamic environments, contributing to successful monitoring applications.


% Designing a robust and efficient mesh network for real-time environmental monitoring poses unique challenges due to the resource-constrained nature of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), a proactive routing protocol \cite{rechache_study_2021}, emerges as a promising candidate, addressing these challenges head-on with its standardized approach, dynamic routing capabilities, and energy-efficient design \cite{alexander_rpl_2012, Kharrufa2019RPL-Based}. Notably, RPL aligns well with our project's key objectives of scalability, reliability, and sustainability.

% One of RPL's critical strengths lies in its ability to dynamically adapt to network changes. An adaptation mentioned in \cite{kharrufa_dynamic_2017}, D-RPL, optimises multihop routing, guaranteeing reliable data collection even when nodes fail or move, or new ones are deployed, a crucial feature for real-time monitoring systems where network conditions are constantly shifting.

% Furthermore, RPL prioritizes energy efficiency \cite{info8040124}. By employing energy-aware path selection and minimizing control overhead, RPL extends the lifespan of individual nodes and the overall network, a significant advantage in resource-constrained environments.

% Finally, RPL exhibits excellent scalability, making it suitable for large-scale WSNs. Its hierarchical design effectively handles complex network structures, ensuring efficient data routing even as the network grows in size and complexity.

% While RPL boasts significant advantages, careful consideration must be given to its limitations before implementation. Security measures require meticulous implementation to address potential vulnerabilities in resource-constrained environments \cite{arena_evaluating_2020, mayzaud_distributed_2017, 8998289}. Additionally, RPL's dynamic nature can introduce complexity and overhead compared to simpler protocols, demanding thoughtful analysis and optimization.

% Balancing RPL's strengths with its limitations is crucial. Its dynamic routing, energy efficiency, and scalability hold immense potential for achieving our project's goals. Leveraging RPL's features, particularly its dynamic routing and multipathing capabilities, promises timely data collection even in dynamic network environments, contributing to a successful monitoring application. Further investigation and experimentation are necessary to determine the optimal configuration and potential adaptations required for RPL to seamlessly integrate into our specific project and effectively meet the desired outcomes.

\subsection{Dynamic Source Routing (DSR)}\label{sec:lr_dsr}
% SHORTENED %
The Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol is a reactive algorithm for projects not requiring real-time data, as it minimises unnecessary transmissions at the cost of initial latency, beneficial for environmental data analysis \cite{5431521}. While the scalability issues in large networks due to route discovery flooding which may potentially increases the workload and energy consumption of the nodes\cite{5431521} can be challenging, the adaptability to netowrk changes and energy efficiency of DSR protocol are remarkable, with the ability to quickly find new routes and conserve energy through dormant nodes as well as route caching \cite{6488843,1431308}. This caching also enhances network reliability, allowing quick switches to alternative paths if one route fails, ensuring consistent data collection \cite{1431308}.

% Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol is a reactive mesh networking algorithm. This approach significantly reduces unnecessary data transmissions, aligning well with projects that do not require real-time data processing \cite{5431521}. Although the on-demand nature of DSR introduces latency during the route discovery process, such delays are not a concern for environmental data collection aimed at analysis, where immediate data retrieval is not critical.

% One potential challenge is its scalability limitations due to the use of a flooding mechanism for route discovery. In extensive networks, this can lead to increased loads on individual nodes, affecting their performance in terms of processing capabilities, latency \cite{6488843}, and energy consumption \cite{energy,1431308}. However, for the proposed project, where the network's configuration remains static after deployment to ensure data consistency, and the scale of the network is moderate, such scalability issues are mitigated.

% DSR's flexibility stands out as a significant benefit, especially useful in environments where conditions frequently change. The protocol can quickly respond to alterations in the network's structure by searching for new routes via broadcasting, thereby ensuring consistent data collection \cite{5497794}. 

% Energy efficiency, derive from the absence of periodic route updates, is another key feature. Nodes remain dormant until data transmission is necessary, conserving energy by batching data uploads to the master node rather than transmitting data continuously. Additionally, DSR's route caching mechanism further enhances its energy efficiency. By storing multiple routes, the protocol reduces the need for frequent route discoveries, conserving valuable network resources \cite{1431308}.

% The use of route caching also contributes to the network's reliability. By maintaining multiple routes to destinations, nodes can swiftly switch to an alternative path in case of route failure, avoiding the latency associated with initiating a new route discovery \cite{1431308}.

\subsection{Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR)}\label{sec:lr_oslr}

% SHORTENED %
In networks using OLSR, nodes select one-hop reachable neighbors to form Multi-Point Relay (MPR) sets, optimizing packet transmission. OLSR's scalability benefits island-wide CO2 monitoring deployments by efficiently managing routing tables and reliably forwarding packets\cite{Kakade2017Performance} \cite{OLSR_IETF} \cite{Ahn2014}. Proactive routing minimizes throughput, reducing energy consumption for non-forwarding nodes\cite{Guo_2011}. OLSR adapts to node failure, ensuring message forwarding reliability, ideal for large urban deployments like Singapore. However, continuous routing table updates increase power consumption, requiring efficient energy management\cite{Wheeb_Nordin_Samah_Kanellopoulos_2023}. While lacking inherent security, encryption and access control mitigate unauthorized access risks. Overall, OLSR offers scalability, reliability, and low latency.

% In networks using the Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR) routing protocol, each node selects a neighbor that is directly reachable (one hop away) when transmitting data packets. These selected neighbors form a set known as Multi-Point Relay (MPR). Only nodes in the MPR set are responsible for forwarding messages, ensuring efficient packet transmission\cite{Kakade2017Performance} \cite{OLSR_IETF}. MPR nodes are chosen to cover as many other nodes as possible within one hop, optimizing network coverage\cite{Ahn2014}. They are sometimes seen in UAV communications\cite{Wheeb_Nordin_Samah_Kanellopoulos_2023}.

% In an island wide C02  Monitoring deployment using OLSR, the scalability of OLSR would highly benefit the how well it is suited for large scale networks with its efficient routing table management and can reliably forward packets . 

% With the nature of OLSR proactive routing can also help minimise network throughput by reducing routing overhead when sending packets. And due to this optimised routing energy consumption is reduced for nodes not involved in message forwarding and processing\cite{Guo_2011}.

% OLSR is also able to adapt to node failure and recalculate routes between nodes to ensure message forwarding reliability which would highly benefit large scale deployments in an urban area like Singapore for effective and reliable monitoring.

% OLSR can significantly impact power consumption due to its continuous need to update and maintain routing tables\cite{Wheeb_Nordin_Samah_Kanellopoulos_2023}. This frequent updating process demands substantial computational resources, potentially draining device batteries faster than other routing protocols.

% While security is not inherent in OLSR, encryption and firewall and access control can be used to reduced risk of unauthorised access and network abuse.

% Overall, Optimized Link State Routing protocol offers several advantages such as scalability, reliability, and low latency, its suitability for large-scale deployment in IoT CO2 monitoring applications.
