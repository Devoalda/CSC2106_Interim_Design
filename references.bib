	abstract = {Low-Power and Lossy Networks ({LLNs}) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained. {LLN} routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power). Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability. {LLNs} are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers. Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the {LLN}), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the {LLN}), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the {LLN} towards a central control point). This document specifies the {IPv}6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks ({RPL}), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the {LLN} towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the {LLN} are supported. Support for point-to-point traffic is also available. [{STANDARDS}-{TRACK}]},

This paper investigates the use of {RPL} in dynamic networks and presents an enhanced {RPL} for different applications with dynamic mobility and diverse network requirements. This implementation of {RPL} is designed with a new dynamic Objective-Function (D-{OF}) to improve the Packet Delivery Ratio ({PDR}), end-to-end delay and energy consumption while maintaining low packet overhead and loop-avoidance. We propose a controlled reverse-trickle timer based on received signal strength identification ({RSSI}) readings to maintain high responsiveness with minimum overhead and consult the objective function when a movement or an inconsistency is detected to help nodes make an informed decision. Simulations are done using Cooja with random waypoint mobility scenario for healthcare applications considering multi-hop routing. The results show that the proposed dynamic {RPL} (D-{RPL}) adapts to the nodes mobility and has a higher {PDR}, slightly lower end-to-end delay and reasonable energy consumption compared to related existing protocols.},

Abstract 
{IPv}6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks ({RPL}) is a proactive dynamic routing protocol based on {IPV}6 with tow known objective functions ({OFs}): objective function zero ({OF}0) and minimum rank with hysteresis objective function ({MRHOF}). 
this memoir, provides an overiew of this protocol with a performance study of the two {OFs} used in {RPL}. Several scenarios have been tested with 20,30,40 and 50 nodes, with tow deffernt topologies (random and linear topology) and two parameters of comparisons were selected packet dilevery ratio and power consumption under differnt values of Packet Reception Ratio {RX} (20,40,60,80 and 100) in order to have an idea of suitability performance of {RPL} in each scenario. 
The simulation is done using the cooja simulator in our implementation cooja is a flexible java-based simulator which support C java native interface. We have chosen a cooja simulator as it is a very useful tool for software development in wireless sensor networks and will provide a suitable method in which to set the environment needs.},

In {WSAN} the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks ({RPL}) has a crucial role as the standard {IPv}6-based routing protocol. {RPL} specifications define a basic set of security features, without which it would be open to disruptive routing attacks. However, the impact of these features on the {WSAN} performance has not been thoroughly investigated yet. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we extensively evaluate the impact of security mechanisms on the scalability of {WSANs} by means of both simulations and real experiments. We show that the protection against eavesdropping and forgery has a modest impact on the performance, whereas the protection against replay has a more considerable impact, especially on the network formation time which increases noticeably. Despite this, we show that protecting against replay reduces the number of control messages exchanged and improves routes optimality. For these reasons, we recommend to always use the security mechanisms. Finally, we propose a standard-compliant optimization for defending against replay that reduces the impact on the overall performance.},

  ABSTRACT = {The RPL (Routing Protocol for LLN) protocol is a routing protocol for low power and lossy networks. In such a network, energy is a very scarce resource, so many studies are focused on minimizing global energy consumption. End-to-end latency is another important performance indicator of the network, but existing research tends to focus more on energy consumption and ignore the end-to-end delay of data transmission. In this paper, we propose a kind of energy equalization routing protocol to maximize the surviving time of the restricted nodes so that the energy consumed by each node is close to each other. At the same time, a multi-path forwarding route is proposed based on the cache utilization. The data is sent to the sink node through different parent nodes at a certain probability, not only by selecting the preferred parent node, thus avoiding buffer overflow and reducing end-to-end delay. Finally, the two algorithms are combined to accommodate different application scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed three improved schemes improve the reliability of the routing, extend the lifetime of the network, reduce the end-to-end delay, and reduce the number of DAG reconfigurations.},

The routing protocol for {LLN} ({RPL}) protocol has been standardized by {IETF} to enable a lightweight and robust routing in these constrained networks. A versioning mechanism is incorporated into {RPL} in order to maintain an optimized topology. However, an attacker can exploit this mechanism to significantly damage the network and reduce its lifetime. After analyzing and comparing existing work, we propose in this paper a monitoring strategy with dedicated algorithms for detecting such attacks and identifying the involved malicious nodes. The performance of this solution is evaluated through extensive experiments, and its scalability is quantified with the support of a monitoring node placement optimization method.},

abstract = {The ad hoc on-demand distance-vector (AODV) routing protocol has been designed for use in ad hoc networks, which are presently receiving wide interest within many diverse research communities. These networks represent a significant departure from traditional wired networks due to the distinguishing characteristics of both the wireless channel and mobile devices. Consequently, AODV incorporates many novel features for handling mobility, reduced capacity links, and the variable, indeterminate nature of the signaling range of wireless media. Since its initial design, AODV has evolved in a number of ways for improved performance, robustness, and better scalability. Nevertheless, we see many opportunities for continued improvement. This paper describes the current state of AODV, including its base functionality as well as optional features that improve performance and add capabilities. We also offer some direction for the continued evolution of AODV by presenting areas that can be targeted for future enhancements. Many of the described current and planned features are a result of AODV’s history and evolution within the Internet engineering task force.}

ABSTRACT = {LoRa is a long-range and low-power radio technology largely employed in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. It defines the lower physical layer while other protocols, such as LoRaWAN, define the upper layers of the network. A LoRaWAN network assumes a star topology where each of the nodes communicates with multiple gateways which, in turn, forward the collected data to a network server. The main LoRaWAN characteristic is the central role of the gateways; however, in some application scenarios, a much lighter protocol stack, relying only on node capabilities and without the presence of gateways, can be more suitable. In this paper, we present a preliminary study for realizing a LoRa-based mesh network, not relying on LoRaWAN, that implements a peer-to-peer communication between nodes, without the use of gateways, and extends node reachability through multi-hop communication. To validate our investigations, we present a hardware/software prototype based on low-power-consumption devices, and we preliminarily assess the proposed solution.},

  abstract={This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR)
   protocol for mobile ad hoc networks.  The protocol is an optimization
   of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of
   a mobile wireless LAN.  The key concept used in the protocol is that
   of multipoint relays (MPRs).  MPRs are selected nodes which forward
   broadcast messages during the flooding process.  This technique
   substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical
   flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it
   receives the first copy of the message.  In OLSR, link state
   information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs.  Thus, a
   second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control
   messages flooded in the network.  As a third optimization, an MPR
   node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR
   selectors.  Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm,
   partial link state information is distributed in the network.  This
   information is then used for route calculation.  OLSR provides
   optimal routes (in terms of number of hops).  The protocol is
   particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique
   of MPRs works well in this context.}
